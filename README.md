# Water's 14-Day JavaScript Chill Timetable

This is a **self-study HTML project** that provides a **14-day learning plan for JavaScript**.  
It’s designed to be **lightweight, stress-free, and interactive** — you check off tasks as you complete them each day.

## About the Timetable
The timetable is split into **two weeks**:
- **Week 1** → Core concepts like storage, timers, promises, async/await, closures, and a first mini project (Todo v1).  
- **Week 2** → More advanced topics like ES modules, event delegation, error handling, array methods, JSON, and two bigger projects (Weather App + Todo v2).  

Each **day card** shows:
- The **topic** to learn  
- A **mini task/project** to apply it  
- Optional **hints** (expandable with `<details>`)  
- A **checkbox** to track your progress  

---

## Features
- **Responsive HTML & CSS** design (works in any browser).  
- **14 days of content**, divided into Week 1 & Week 2.  
- **Progress checkboxes** to keep track of what’s done.  
- Expandable **hints** with tips for each task.

By the end of 14 days, you’ll have built:  
- A **Todo app (v1 & v2)**  
- A **Weather app**  
- Plus confidence with promises, async, closures, modules, and storage.
