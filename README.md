## 📖 About the Timetable
The timetable is split into **two weeks**:
- **Week 1** → Core concepts like storage, timers, promises, async/await, closures, and a first mini project (Todo v1).  
- **Week 2** → More advanced topics like ES modules, event delegation, error handling, array methods, JSON, and two bigger projects (Weather App + Todo v2).  

Each **day card** shows:
- The **topic** to learn  
- A **mini task/project** to apply it  
- Optional **hints** (expandable with `<details>`)  
- A **checkbox** to track your progress
